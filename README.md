Picoripheral
============

Tooling to allow the use of a raspberry pi pico as a peripheral for a full 
size raspberry pi - exposing ADC reading etc. over i2c. Intention is for clock
based electronics to be probed so there are clock drivers as a part of this, 
driven by PIO blocks. 

Yeh this is also me learning how to do IRQ etc, so super work in progress...
